    Performs authentication throttling by username and IP.

    Any POST request to one of the supplied login URLs is assumed to be a login
    attempt. The Django cache is used to store failure counts and timestamps:
    If it is found that there is a throttling delay applicable to the attempt
    that has not yet elapsed, a response is returned using the template for
    that URL, with an error informing the user of the situation. Otherwise,
    the request is allowed to continue, and a response handler checks
    request.user to determine whether the login attempt succeeded.

                                    simply return a HTTP 429 error.
        DELAY_FUNCTION -            a function of two arguments, called when a
                                    request is being considered for throttling:
                                    The first argument is the number of failed

                                    username being supplied since the last
                                    success, and the second argument is the
                                    number of attempts from the IP. The
                                    function should return a pair: The number
                                    of seconds to delay the next attempt on
                                    that username, and the number of seconds to
